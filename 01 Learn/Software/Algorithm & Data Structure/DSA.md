# Data Structure & Algorithm

Why 

[[Data Structure]]
Data structures are a way of organizing and storing information in a computer or a program. They help to efficiently manage and manipulate data.

&
[[Algorithm]]
An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions, a step-by-step procedure designed to solve a specific problem or perform a particular task.

how can we measure algorithm performance? There are two main ways:

1. Measuring the implementation of an algorithm, running the code on various inputs, and measuring the time and the memory it takes. This is called **profiling**.
2. Reasoning about an algorithm in more abstract terms, using a simplified model for the machine it would run on and abstracting many details. In this case, we focus on coming up with a mathematical law describing the running time and the memory in terms of the input size. This is called **asymptotic analysis**.

Both profiling and asymptotic analysis are useful at different stages of the development process. Asymptotic analysis is mostly used during the design phase because it helps you choose the right data structures and algorithms
Profiling is useful after you have written an implementation to check for bottlenecks in your code. It detects problems in your implementation, but it can also help you under stand if you are using the wrong data structure in case you skipped the asymptotic analysis or drew the wrong conclusions.

[[Big O]]
we are going to focus on asymptotic analysis, so we will briefly describe the notation commonly used to express the formulas that describe the algorithms’ behavior. Asymptotic analysis uses a generic (and simplified) representation of a computer on which we imagine running our algorithms. It’s important that we begin by describing this model because it deeply influences how we perform our analysis.
